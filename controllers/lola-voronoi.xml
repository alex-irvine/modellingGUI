		LOLA-Voronoi performs a trade-off between exploration (filling up the design space evenly) and focusing on areas which
		are typically difficult to approximate with surrogate or approximation models, such as nonlinear regions and local optima.
		To do this, LOLA uses LOcal Linear Approximations of the simulator to estimate the local nonlinearity, and select samples
		in the most nonlinear regions.
